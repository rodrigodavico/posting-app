<h3>## Posting App details ##</h3>

<p>Posting App is a testbed for experimentation with the Laravel framework.
The app will let you register, log in, edit your user data, post info into the site, like, delete and modify stuff, and more.</p>

<p>It's built on Laravel 8 using artisan, migrations, controllers, models, elocuent rels, tailwindcss for styling and some things I'm probably forgetting right now.</p>

<p>To run just download and serve it with artisan, remember to set up your .env file and create a db for the app to use.</p>

Cheers!
